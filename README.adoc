Command line tool for checking planetary interaction extractors in EVE Online

image::{img}/sample_output.png[]

== Requirements

This application has been written using https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] version
7.7.1. It has been tested with that node version under Windows 10. I didn't
test it anywhere else. So use at your own risk.

== Installation

1. Clone the repo
1. run `npm install`

== Usage

Run the application by typing `node src/pi_check.js`. This will start up a
chrome in private mode asking for your credentials and giving access to your
planetary colonies. If you leave the browser open you can reuse the login and
further invocations will directly lead to the character selection.

The program will check all your planets extractors and highlight those below a
threshold. The default threshold is one day. You can use another threshold from
the command line by adding a value in the format `"hours:minutes"` or `"days
hours:minutes"`. For example `"12:00"` would check for extractors running out
in under twelve hours, `"2 0:0"` would check for extractors running out in under
two days.

NOTE: If your output is colorless try adding `--color` at the end.
